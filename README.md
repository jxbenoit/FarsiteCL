# FarsiteCL
A version of FARSITE derived from the GUI version of FARSITE 4 &amp; command-line version code released downloaded in circa 2006..

## 202003021148: Gave this code to UCSB for batch fire modeling project.  
They were able to compile it on a Linux system. However, there are some known 'classic' issues:  
  * Landscape files are not being read correctly.
  * The simulation of fire they are trying to model (Sharpa) crashes after producing the first perimeter.
